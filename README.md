# medical_insurance_project
This is my first ever project written in Python without an external help provided by Codecademy instructions. I was given a CSV file that contained a set of data that contained information about holders of the insurance.

In this project, I had an opportunity to explore data in any way I want. Thus, I 1) found the youngest customer; 2) calculated an average value of the BMI and insurance cost; 3) counted the number of female and male insurance holders; 4) delved deeper and analysed an average insurance cost for smokers vs. non-smokers and insurance holders with kids vs. no kids.
